# Cryptography Course – Homework 2, Task 1

This is a public repository for homework assignments from the cryptography course.  
In this task we compared the quality of pseudorandom sequences generated by different Python modules and OpenSSL using the **dieharder** statistical test suite.

---

## Tested Generators

1. **OpenSSL** – cryptographically secure reference sequence.
2. **Python `random`** – Mersenne Twister (not cryptographically secure).  
3. **Python `secrets`** – based on system source (`/dev/urandom`), cryptographically secure.  

---

## Results of Statistical Testing

### 1. OpenSSL
- **All tests passed**.  
- 2 tests reported `WEAK` (`marsaglia_tsang_gcd`, `rgb_lagged_sum`).  
- **0 FAILED**.  

 The sequence is of high quality. Occasional `WEAK` results are normal due to statistical fluctuations.

---

### 2. Python `random`
- **All tests passed**.  
- 2 tests reported `WEAK` (`sts_serial|8`, `rgb_lagged_sum|7`).  
- **0 FAILED**.  

 Although statistically fine, this generator is **not cryptographically secure** and can be predicted.

---

### 3. Python `secrets`
- **Most tests passed**.  
- 5 tests reported `WEAK` results (`sts_serial|4`, `sts_serial|10`, `rgb_permutations|2`, `rgb_lagged_sum|4`, `rgb_lagged_sum|14`, ``).  
- **1 FAILED** test (`rgb_lagged_sum|9`).

 The sequence is generally strong, but a single failed test shows that even cryptographically secure generators can occasionally fail in statistical batteries.

## Summary Table

| Generator   | WEAK tests | FAILED tests | Conclusion |
|-------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| OpenSSL     | 2          | 0            | High quality, secure |
| random      | 2          | 0            | Statistically OK, **not secure** |
| secrets     | 5          | 1            | Strong, secure, minor anomalies |

## Answers to Questions

**1. How many tests did each sequence fail?**  
- OpenSSL: **0**  
- random: **0**  
- secrets: **1**

**2. Can we determine from statistical tests whether a pseudorandom number generator is cryptographically secure or just ordinary?**  
No.  
Statistical test suites like **dieharder** only check for randomness anomalies.  
They **cannot distinguish a cryptographically secure generator from a normal one**.  
For example, `random` passes almost all tests but is predictable and insecure.  
To determine cryptographic security, one must analyze the **generator algorithm**, not only its statistical behavior.
