Explanation: 

1. Creation of an RSA private key (2048 біт)

cmd: openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

Where:

-algorithm RSA — indicates that the RSA algorithm is being used
-out server.key — the name of the file where the key will be saved
-pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 — specifies the key length (2048 bits — the standard secure length)

Result: a server.key file will be created in PEM format


2. Viewing the key contents

cmd: openssl rsa -text -in server.key

This command will decrypt the contents and show:

-modulus (n) — a large number that is part of the public key
-publicExponent (e) — usually 65537
-privateExponent (d) — the private component
-as well as the primes p and q from which the key is built

This is the private information. It allows the private key to be reconstructed

3. Obtain the public key in PEM format:

cmd: openssl rsa -in server.key -pubout -out public.pem
