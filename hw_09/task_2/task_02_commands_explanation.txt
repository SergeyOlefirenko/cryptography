Explanation: 

1. Generation CSR:

openssl req -new -keyout server.key -out server.csr -subj "/C=UA/L=Kyiv/O=Robot_dreams/CN=www.robotdreams.cc/emailAddress=youremail@example.com" -nodes

Where:

-new — create a new request CSR
-key server.key — an existing private key is used
-out server.csr — the file where the CSR will be saved
-subj "/C=UA/L=Kyiv/O=Robot_dreams/CN=www.robotdreams.cc/emailAddress=youremail@example.com" — metadata (C = Country, L = City, O = Organization, CN = Common Name, emailAddress = email)
-nodes — the key is not encrypted with a password у CSR

After this, a file is created server.csr.


2. Content verification CSR:

Result: public key, matadata (CN, O, C e.t.c.), Signature created with the private key
