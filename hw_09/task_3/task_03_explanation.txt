Explanation:

1. Creating a self-signed certificate

cmd: openssl x509 -req -sha256 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Where:

-req — certificate based on CSR
-sha256 — hashing algorithm for signature
-in server.csr — вхідний CSR
-signkey server.key — signing with our own private key
-out server.crt — original certificate file


2. Certificate content verification

cmd: openssl x509 -text -noout -in server.crt


Result:

Subject (owner data),
Issuer (the same, because the certificate is self-signed),
Validity (expiration period),
Public Key,
Signature SHA-256.


3. Structure view ASN.1

openssl asn1parse -in server.crt

Allows viewing the internal structure of the certificate as an ASN.1 tree structure
