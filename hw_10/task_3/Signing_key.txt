Updating GitHub CLI token permissions so it can work with Signing keys:

gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:ssh_signing_key
-h github.com — for the main GitHub
-s admin:ssh_signing_key — grants access to work with Signing keys

After successfully updating the permissions, add the key as a Signing key:

gh ssh-key add C:\Users\Asus\.ssh\id_ed25519_git.pub --title "Signing key" --type signing


Check that the key is loaded in the ssh-agent:

ssh-add -l
